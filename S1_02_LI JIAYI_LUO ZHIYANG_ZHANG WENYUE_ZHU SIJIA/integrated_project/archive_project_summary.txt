Section (1) - PROJECT INFORMATION
---------------------------------
Name      = integrated_project
Directory = C:/Users/86131/Downloads/EE2026/integrated_project v3.0.xpr/integrated_project

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.

         accessible. To resolve this issue, please set this property with the desired path
         before launching simulation:-

Property = compxlib.xsim_compiled_library_dir
Path     =
